 1,what is the difference  HTML and XHTML  and its version?

Both XHTML and HTML have their advantages and disadvantages, but it’s hard to pick out a winning one. All of it depends on personal needs and the alignment of features offered by the two of them.
    
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, while XHTML is a stricter and 
more standardized version of HTML. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of features, 
such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.
in html:-we can close tags anytime and anywhere as our needs.
lewd structure is used.
we can add attribute without any quotes.
Hypertext: Hypertext refers to the “text wrapped within a text.” It is very similar to hyperlinks and contains an underlying text that, when clicked, redirects to a new webpage.
It was developed by Tim Berners Lee.
Filename Extension	An HTML file can be saved with the extensions – .html, .htm.
Markup language: A markup language is not necessarily a programming language. Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document. This leads to more interactive and dynamic text content
on the other hand 

      In XHTML its mandatory to close all the tags in strict
residing order as they where declared.
It is mandatory to add quotes on every attribute we declare
XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
XHTML is almost similar to HTML but it is stricter than HTML
It is swift, accurate, easily maintained, convertible, and formatted
All major browsers support XHTML
It contains a very strict structure, and the developer cannot go out of the bounds of these structures.
xhtml is attributes names must be in lowercase
and also it attributes must be minimization is fobidden etc
It was developed by W3C – World Wide Web Consortium
An XHTML file has extensions – .xhtml, .xht, .html, .htm, .xml.
Virsion of html

     html 1.0

The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. 
 It does not have rich features like styling and other things thatwere related to how content will be
 rendered in a browser.
The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc. 
     
       html 2.0

it is a non-proprietary format, openly documented specification and freely implementable.
HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of improving HTML version 1.0
     html 3.2
It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next version of HTML was 3.2
 HTML 3.2 adds widely deployed features such as tables, applets, text flow around images, superscripts and subscript

      html 4.01

It was developed in 1999. It extended the support of cascading styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded
 in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must
 place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.
To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 concept of an external styling sheet emerged. Under this concept, 
an external CSS file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself. 
HTML 4.01 provided support for further new tags of HTML
   
      html 5

This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it could be used in 2014. It came up with lots o
 HTML tags support. HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input element s of different types;
 geolocations support tags, etc
